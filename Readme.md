# Heroku Toolbelt

The Heroku Toolbelt is a package of the Heroku CLI, Foreman, and Git —
all the tools you need to get started using Heroku at the command
line. The Toolbelt is available as a native installer for OS X and
Windows, and is available from an apt-get repository for Debian/Ubuntu
Linux.

This repository is a static site with instructions and downloads for
the toolbelt packages.

# Setup

Run `bundle exec rake` to run the site's test suite.

# Publishing Updates

[Toolbelt releases are now done inside the CLI repo.](https://github.com/heroku/heroku/blob/master/RELEASE.md)
